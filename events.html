        <h1>May 9th | John Wick - Chapter 3 Parabellum - World Premiere</h1>
        <div class="divided">
            <div class="column1">
                <p> With summer movie season now in full swing, the cast and crew of the highly anticipated John Wick:
                    Chapter 3—Parabellum gathered in Brooklyn Thursday night for the world premiere screening.</p>
                <p>“It’s so beautiful looking and really incredibly well choreographed,” says Anjelica Huston, who makes
                    her John Wick series debut in the new film, opening this Friday. “It’s astonishing what these people
                    do! And there’s very little CGI because Keanu [Reeves] does about 98 percent of his stunts; it’s
                    really incredible to watch him go through these movies.”</p>
                <p>After the screening, everyone was shuttled from the theater to a venue decked out to resemble the
                    sinister Continental Hotel. Housed at One Hanson Place in the heart of Downtown Brooklyn, the
                    after-party was an immersive event set in the real interior shooting location. Hotel staff and
                    characters from the movie were even present, interacting with guests and dispensing souvenir gold
                    coins used in the films as currency for services in the criminal underworld. The notoriously shy
                    Reeves mingled with guests as ABBA played from the DJ booth, with cocktails being slung out at a
                    rapid pace and the occasional interruption from a classical ballet performance on the balcony of the
                    “hotel.” But given the “more is more” mentality at the heart of the John Wick films, the evening
                    felt like an especially fitting celebration.</p>

        <h1>May 6th | John Wick – Chapter 3 Parabellum – Berlin Photocall</h1>
        <div class="divided">
            <div class="column1">
                <p>It turns out that mid-budget Hollywood films still aren’t dead yet, with “John Wick: Chapter 3 –
                    Parabellum” absolutely killing it at the box office lately. The “John Wick” movies are here to stay.
                </p>
                <p>“John Wick: Chapter 2” back in 2017 had a very “middle chapter of a trilogy” vibe to it, with the
                    events of the first film setting John down a dark path and ending the way all good action trilogies
                    do — with our hero finding himself in a dire situation that he must spend the next movie trying to
                    get out of.
                </p>
                <p>But while we’re trained by decades of franchise movies to think of film series in threes — and these
                    three movies certainly do have a trilogy structure, as I just mentioned — “John Wick: Chapter 3 –
                    Parabellum” is certainly not the end of this thing. The film ends on another cliffhanger, putting
                    Mr. Wick in yet another dire situation that he’s going to have to spend yet another movie trying to
                    get out of. Far from being a trilogy capper that puts Reeves’ hero character out to pasture, the
                    third “John Wick” movie ends by pointing directly ahead to another sequel.</p>

                <p>He plays the ruthless hit man trying to flee the world's top assassins in his latest blockbuster.
                    But Keanu Reeves looked quite the gentleman as he attended a special screening of John Wick: Chapter
                    3-Parabellum on Friday.
                    The Matrix actor, 54, donned a suave black suit as he posed for the cameras at The Ham Yard Hotel in
                    London.
                </p>
                <p>The leading man teamed his dapper two-piece suit with a slick black tie and a pair of black Grenson
                    Brady hiker boots with criss-cross laces.
                    He left his shoulder-length hair loose and showed off his grown-out beard as he smiled for the
                    cameras at the lavish event at the 5-star hotel.
                </p>
                <p>Joining the Hollywood star for the private screening was director of the highly-anticipated film Chad
                    Stahelski who sported smart black trousers, a black top and jacket.
                    The third installment of the action thriller will follow assassin John Wick, played by Keanu Reeves,
                    as he runs away from a group of highly-skilled assassins intent on taking his life.</p>
